.Synopsis
    Takes a PSCredential object and makes a clixml file.
.DESCRIPTION
    The New-CredentialXML cmdlet creates a clixml file for use in scheduled scripts that require credentials to run. The clixml objects are used by Import-Clixml
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> New-CredentialXML -Path 'C:\CredentialStore'

    This command gets a credential object, then creates the clixml file in the CredentialStore folder.

    When you enter the command, a dialog box appears requesting a user name and password. When the information is entered, the cmdlet creates a PSCredential object and converts that to a clixml file.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> New-CredentialXML -Path 'C:\CredentialStore' -Credential $Cred

    This command gets a credential object from the parameter, then creates the clixml file in the CredentialStore folder.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> $Cred = Get-Credential
    PS C:\> $Cred | New-CredentialXML -Path 'C:\CredentialStore'

    This command gets the credential object from the pipeline and creates the clixml file in the CredentialStore folder.
.INPUTS
    System.Management.Automation.PSCredential

    You can pipe a PSCredential object to New-CredentialXML.
.OUTPUTS
    None
